Thank you for using `posterdown` ! Please fill add the following information to your issue request for best results and faster response times:

1) Please list the poster template/ templates in which you are submitting the issue about. For example you can put a single template if the issue is specific to it such as `posterdown_html`; or you may have an issue which more then one template is impacted so you can put `posterdown_betterland` & `posterdown_betterport`

2) Please indicate your operating system, R and RStudio versions as necessary.

3) Please indicate which version of `posterdown` you are using, either [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/posterdown/index.html) or github.

4) Please briefly and clearly state the issue you are having, the expected results, and any possible fixes that you have tried which have _**not**_ worked. This includes example code which should be written in a reproducible manner.

5) Delete the text here and above once you feel 1-4 have been sufficiently answered, thanks!
